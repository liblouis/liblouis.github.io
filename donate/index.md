title: Donate to Liblouis
---

We're a group of open-source software developers. We work on
Liblouis, an open-source braille translation library for a large
number of languages and braille codes, written in C. It is used in
many products and if you're a braille user, odds are you have come
across braille that was produced by Liblouis.

## Why donate?

Liblouis is an important piece of software for a lot of products, but
its development relies heavily on volunteer work, and our time is
limited. Most of us have regular day jobs and try to work on Liblouis
in our [20% project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project) or
in our spare time.

Your donation will support us in our work maintaining Liblouis. With
the extra revenue we can afford to invest more time in the project
than we would otherwise. <!--Your funds will also be spent on issue
bounties as a way to reward other Liblouis contributors.-->

If you use Liblouis in your daily routine and it makes your life
easier, you can show your appreciation by giving us a small tip. If
you run a business or non-profit that benefits from Liblouis, consider
sponsoring us a bit more generously to guarantee Liblouis stays
healthy and actively maintained.

If you or your organisation would like to support us in our efforts to
move Liblouis forward, you may make a (tax-deductible) donation, using
the PayPal button above. PayPal also offers the option of secure card
payment, with debit or credit card. You can donate any amount. You can
donate once or set up a recurring monthly donation (which can be
amended or cancelled at any time).

Donations are managed by the [Software Freedom
Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), a 501(c)3 non-profit
organisation that, apart from fiscal sponsorship, provides legal
assistance and a framework for long-term stewardship of the Liblouis
project.

Donations made to Software Freedom Conservancy are fully
tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. The majority of
donation funds go directly towards supporting the Liblouis project. A
small portion of the funds are set aside for the Software Freedom
Conservancy to continue their work in supporting Liblouis and other
open source initiatives.

## Specific engagements

You may also hire [Bert Frees](https://github.com/bertfrees) to do a
specific job. Get in touch and we'll try to work something out.
