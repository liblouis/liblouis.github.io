<p>Back-translation refers to the process of translating backwards,
i.e. from Braille to text. For many years, Liblouis was mainly
concerned with forward translation, and so were most of the authors of
the translation tables. Today however, Liblouis is being used
extensively in conjunction with screen reading programs like NVDA and
JAWS for Windows as well as Braille note-takers like BrailleSense from
HIMS and BrailleNote from HumanWare. So when writing a translation
table for Liblouis, it is indeed relevant to consider how the table
will work when used for back-translation, if anything special must be
done, or if you want to write separate tables for forward translation
and back-translation.
</p>
<p>Back-translation is generally harder to do in a computer program than
forward translation. Ideally, any text could be translated to Braille
and then translated back to text giving exactly the same result as the
original. However, many Braille codes omit a lot of information and
leaves it to the reader to fill in the missing bits. An example of this
is letters with accents. In languages where accents are uncommon, e.g.
English, Accented letters are usually just marked with a Braille
indicator stating that there is an accent, but not which accent, even
though this may be crucial to the meaning of the word or the sentence.
Another example of this is when not all capital letters are marked in
the Braille code, but only the &quot;important&quot; capital letters. A third
example is when a Braille character serves as both a punctuation sign,
a math sign, and perhaps even as a contraction, and the Braille code
then leaves it up to the reader to use his/her knowledge of the context
to decide the meaning of the Braille character.
</p>
<p>In some cases, you may need to bend the rules of the Braille code if it
is important to create Braille that can be properly back-translated.
This may include marking all capital letters instead of just the
&quot;important&quot; ones, or perhaps marking a Braille character with an
indicator stating that this character should in fact be interpreted as
a math sign and not a punctuation or Braille contraction. In some
cases, the best solution may be to create two separate sets of tables
for forward translation: One set for Braille that must be
back-translatable (for use with screen readers and note-takers), and
another for good and nice literary Braille (for embossing).
But no matter how you bend the Braille code, the back-translation
process may not be perfect.

<p>Back-translation is carried out by the function
<code class="code">lou_backTranslateString</code>. Its calling sequence is described in
<a class="ref" href="Programming-with-liblouis.html">Programming with liblouis</a>. <code class="code">lou_backTranslateString</code> first
performs <code class="code">pass4</code>, if
present, then <code class="code">pass3</code>, then <code class="code">pass2</code>, then the
backtranslation, then corrections. Note that this is exactly the
inverse of forward translation.
</p>
<p>Most opcodes can be preceded by <code class="code">noback</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Translation-Opcodes.html#noback-opcode"><code class="code">noback</code></a>) or <code class="code">nofor</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Translation-Opcodes.html#nofor-opcode"><code class="code">nofor</code></a>),
and the <code class="code">correct</code>, <code class="code">context</code> and multi-pass opcodes must be
preceded with either <code class="code">noback</code> or <code class="code">nofor</code>. So in most cases,
it will be perfectly possible to make one table for translation in both
directions, although a separate table for forward and backward
translation might be more readable in some cases.
</p>
<p>Most of the opcodes associated with pass 1 have two operands, a
character operand to the left and a dots operand to the right. During
forward translation, these operands are used to replace the characters
with the dot pattern according to the conditions of the opcode. The
opcode works from left to right. When back-translating, these opcodes
work the opposite way. The dot patterns are replaced by the text. The
opcodes work from right to left.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <code class="code">correct</code>, <code class="code">context</code> and multi-pass
opcodes have a test part to the left and an action part to the right.
These opcodes work from left to right in both translation directions.
The test is performed, and if true, the action is executed, i.e.
replacing, inserting or deleting characters or dots. This is why a
translation direction always has to be specified with these opcodes
using <code class="code">noback</code> or <code class="code">nofor</code>.
