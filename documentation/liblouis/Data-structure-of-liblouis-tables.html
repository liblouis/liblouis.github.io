<h3 class="section" id="Data-structure-of-liblouis-tables-1"><span>7.2 Data structure of liblouis tables<a class="copiable-link" href="#Data-structure-of-liblouis-tables-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>The data structure <code class="code">TranslationTableHeader</code> is defined by a
<code class="code">typedef</code> statement in <samp class="file">louis.h</samp>. To find the beginning,
search for the word &lsquo;<samp class="samp">header</samp>&rsquo;. As its name implies, this is
actually the table header. Data are placed in the <code class="code">ruleArea</code>
array, which is the last item defined in this structure. This array is
declared with a length of 1 and is expanded as needed. The table
header consists mostly of arrays of pointers of size <code class="code">HASHNUM</code>.
These pointers are actually offsets into <code class="code">ruleArea</code> and point to
chains of items which have been placed in the same hash bucket by a
simple hashing algorithm. <code class="code">HASHNUM</code> should be a prime and is
currently 1123. The structure of the table was chosen to optimize
speed rather than memory usage.
</p>
<p>The first part of the table contains miscellaneous information, such
as the number of passes and whether various opcodes have been used. It
also contains the amount of memory allocated to the table and the
amount actually used.
</p>
<p>The next section contains pointers to various braille indicators and
begins with <code class="code">capitalSign</code>. The rules pointed to contain the 
dot pattern for the indicator and an opcode which is used by the
back-translator but does not appear in the list of opcodes. The
braille indicators also include various kinds of emphasis, such as
italic and bold and information about the length of emphasized
phrases. The latter is contained directly in the table item instead of
in a rule.
</p>
<p>After the braille indicators comes information about when a letter
sign should be used.
</p>
<p>Next is an array of size <code class="code">HASHNUM</code> which points to character
definitions. These are created by the character-definition opcodes.
</p>
<p>Following this is a similar array pointing to definitions of
single-cell dot patterns. This is also created from the
character-definition opcodes. If a character definition contains a
multi-cell dot pattern this is compiled into ordinary forward and
backward rules. If such a multi-cell dot pattern contains a single
cell which has not previously been defined that cell is placed in this
array, but is given the attribute <code class="code">space</code>.
</p>
<p>Next come arrays that map characters to single-cell dot patterns and
dots to characters. These are created from both character-definition
opcodes and display opcodes.
</p>
<p>Next is an array of size 256 which maps characters in this range to
dot patterns which may consist of multiple cells. It is used, for
example, to map &lsquo;<samp class="samp">{</samp>&rsquo; to dots 456-246. These mappings are created
by the <code class="code">compdots</code> 
or the <code class="code">comp6</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Translation-Opcodes.html#comp6-opcode"><code class="code">comp6</code></a>).
</p>
<p>Next are two small arrays that held pointers to chains of rules
produced by the <code class="code">swapcd</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Swap-Opcodes.html#swapcd-opcode"><code class="code">swapcd</code></a>) and the <code class="code">swapdd</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Swap-Opcodes.html#swapdd-opcode"><code class="code">swapdd</code></a>) and by
some multipass, <code class="code">context</code> and <code class="code">correct</code> opcodes.
</p>
<p>Now we get to an array of size <code class="code">HASHNUM</code> which points to chains
of rules for forward translation.
</p>
<p>Following this is a similar array for back-translation.
</p>
<p>Finally is the <code class="code">ruleArea</code>, an array of variable size to which
various structures are mapped and to which almost everything else
points.
