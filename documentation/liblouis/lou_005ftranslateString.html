  const char *tableList,

<p>This function takes a string of Unicode characters in
<code class="code">inbuf</code> and translates it into a string of characters in
<code class="code">outbuf</code>. Each character produces a particular dot pattern
in one braille cell when sent to an embosser or braille display or to
a screen type font. Which character represents which dot pattern
is indicated by the character-definition and display opcodes in the
translation table.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="translation_002dtables"></a><p>The <code class="code">tableList</code> parameter points to a list of translation tables
separated by commas. See <a class="xref" href="How-tables-are-found.html">How tables are found</a>, for a description on
how the tables are located in the file system. If only one table is
given, no comma should be used after it. It is these tables which
control just how the translation is made, whether in Grade 2, Grade 1,
or something else.
</p>
<p>The tables in a list are all compiled into the same internal table.
The list is then regarded as the name of this table. As explained in
<a class="ref" href="How-to-Write-Translation-Tables.html">How to Write Translation Tables</a>, each table is a file which may
be plain text, big-endian Unicode or little-endian Unicode. A table
(or list of tables) is compiled into an internal representation the
first time it is used. Liblouis keeps track of which tables have been
compiled. For this reason, it is essential to call the <code class="code">lou_free</code>
function at the end of your application to avoid memory leaks. Do
<em class="emph">NOT</em> call <code class="code">lou_free</code> after each translation. This will
force liblouis to compile the translation tables each time they are
used, leading to great inefficiency.
</p>
<p>Note that both the <code class="code">*inlen</code> and <code class="code">*outlen</code> parameters are
pointers to integers. When the function is called, these integers
contain the maximum input and output lengths, respectively. When it
returns, they are set to the actual lengths used.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="typeform-parameter"></a><p>The <code class="code">typeform</code> parameter is used to indicate italic type,
boldface type, computer braille, etc. It is an array of <code class="code">formtype</code>
with the same length as the input buffer pointed to by <code class="code">*inbuf</code>.
However, it is used to pass back character-by-character results, so
enough space must be provided to match the <code class="code">*outlen</code> parameter.
Each element indicates the typeform of the corresponding character
in the input buffer. The values and their meaning can be consulted in the
<code class="code">typeforms</code> enum in <samp class="file">liblouis.h</samp>. These values can be
added for multiple emphasis. If this parameter is <code class="code">NULL</code>, no
checking for type forms is done. In addition, if this parameter is not
<code class="code">NULL</code>, it is set on return to have an 8 at every position
corresponding to a character in <code class="code">outbuf</code> which was defined to
have a dot representation containing dot 7, dot 8 or both, and to 0
otherwise.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">spacing</code> parameter is used to indicate differences in
spacing between the input string and the translated output string. It
is also of the same length as the string pointed to by <code class="code">*inbuf</code>.
If this parameter is <code class="code">NULL</code>, no spacing information is computed.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">mode</code> parameter specifies how the translation should be
done. The valid values of mode are defined in <samp class="file">liblouis.h</samp>. They
are all powers of 2, so that a combined mode can be specified by
adding up different values.
</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="code">mode</code> parameter is an integer, not a pointer to
an integer.
</p>
<p>A combination of the following mode flags can be used with the
<code class="code">lou_translateString</code> function:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">compbrlAtCursor</code></dt>
<dd><p>If this bit is set in the <code class="code">mode</code> parameter the space-bounded
characters containing the cursor will be translated in computer
braille.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">compbrlLeftCursor</code></dt>
<dd><p>If this bit is set, only the characters to the left of the cursor will
be in computer braille. This bit overrides <code class="code">compbrlAtCursor</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">dotsIO</code></dt>
<dd><p>When this bit is set, during forward translation, Liblouis will produce
output as dot patterns. During back-translation Liblouis accepts input
as dot patterns. Note that the produced dot patterns are affected if
you have any <code class="code">display</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Miscellaneous-Opcodes.html#display-opcode"><code class="code">display</code></a>) defined in any of your tables.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">ucBrl</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code class="code">ucBrl</code> (Unicode Braille) bit is used by the functions
<code class="code">lou_charToDots</code> and <code class="code">lou_translate</code>. It causes the dot
patterns to be Unicode Braille rather than the liblouis representation.
Note that you will not notice any change when setting <code class="code">ucBrl</code>
unless <code class="code">dotsIO</code> is also set. <code class="code">lou_dotsToChar</code> and
<code class="code">lou_backTranslate</code> recognize Unicode braille automatically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">partialTrans</code></dt>
<dd><p>This flag specifies that back-translation input should be treated as an
incomplete word. Rules that apply only for complete words or at the end
of a word will not take effect. This is intended to be used when
translating input typed on a braille keyboard to provide a rough idea
to the user of the characters they are typing before the word is
complete.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">noUndefined</code></dt>
<dd><p>Setting this bit disables the output of hexadecimal values when
forward-translating undefined characters (characters that are not
matched by any rule), and dot numbers when back-translating undefined
braille patterns (braille patterns that are not matched by any
rule). The default is for liblouis to output the hexadecimal value (as
&rsquo;\xhhhh&rsquo;) of an undefined character when forward-translating and the
dot numbers (as \ddd/) of an undefined braille pattern when
back-translating.
</p>
<p>When back translating input from a braille keyboard cell by cell, it
is desirable to output characters as soon as they are
produced. Similarly, when back translating contracted braille, it is
desirable to provide a &quot;guess&quot; to the user of the characters they
typed. To achieve this, liblouis needs to have the ability to produce
no text when indicators (which don&rsquo;t produce a character by
themselves) are not followed by another cell. This works automatically
for indicators liblouis knows about such as capital sign, number sign,
etc., but it does not work for indicators which are not (and cannot
be) specifically defined as indicators. For example, in UEB, dots 4 5
6 alone produces the text &quot;\456/&quot;. Setting the noUndefined mode
suppresses this dot number output.

<p>The function returns 1 if no errors were encountered<a class="footnote" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a> and 0 otherwise.

<p>When the
output buffer is not big enough, <code class="code">lou_translateString</code> returns a
partial translation that is more or less accurate up until the
returned <code class="code">inlen</code>/<code class="code">outlen</code>, and treats it as a successful
translation, i.e. also returns 1.</p>
