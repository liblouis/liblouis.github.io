<h3 class="section" id="Translation-Opcodes-1"><span>2.9 Translation Opcodes<a class="copiable-link" href="#Translation-Opcodes-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>These opcodes define the braille representations for character
sequences. Each of them defines an entry within the contraction table.
These entries may be defined in any order except, as noted below, when
they define alternate representations for the same character sequence.
</p>
<p>Each of these opcodes specifies a condition under which the
translation is legal, and each also has a characters operand and a
dots operand. The text being translated is processed strictly from
left to right, character by character, with the most eligible entry
for each position being used. If there is more than one eligible entry
for a given position in the text, then the one with the longest
character string is used. If there is more than one eligible entry for
the same character string, then the one defined first is tested for
legality first. (This is the only case in which the order of the
entries makes a difference.)
</p>
<p>The characters operand is a sequence or string of characters preceded
and followed by whitespace. Each character can be entered in the
normal way, or it can be defined as a four-digit hexadecimal number
preceded by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\x</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The dots operand defines the braille representation for the characters
operand. It may also be specified as an equals sign (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">=</samp>&rsquo;). This
means that the default representation for each character
(see <a class="pxref" href="Character_002dDefinition-Opcodes.html">Character-Definition Opcodes</a>) within the sequence is to be
used. It is an error if not all the characters in the rule have been
previously defined in a character-definition rule. Note that the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">=</samp>&rsquo; shortcut for dot patterns has a known bug<a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
that might cause problems when back-translating.
</p>
<p>In what follows the word &lsquo;<samp class="samp">characters</samp>&rsquo; means a sequence of one or
more consecutive letters between spaces and/or punctuation marks.

<dl class="table">
<dd>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-noback"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="noback-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">noback opcode ...</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is an opcode prefix, that is to say, it modifies the operation of 
the opcode that follows it on the same line. noback specifies that
back-translation is not to use information on this line.

<dt><code class="code">nofor opcode ...</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is an opcode prefix which modifies the operation of the opcode

<a class="anchor" id="nocross-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">nocross opcode characters ...</code></dt>
<dd><p><code class="code">nocross</code> is an opcode prefix which modifies the operation of the
opcode following it. The following opcode can be <code class="code">always</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#always-opcode"><code class="code">always</code></a>) or
any other translation opcode listed below with <code class="code">characters</code> as
the first operand. <code class="code">nocross</code> specifies that the operation should
not be done when the characters are not all in one syllable (when they
cross a syllable boundary). For this opcode to work, a hyphenation
table must be included. If this is not done, <code class="code">nocross</code> is
ignored. For example, if the English Grade 2 table is being used and
the appropriate hyphenation table has been included <code class="code">nocross
always sh 146</code> will cause the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">sh</samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp class="samp">monkshood</samp>&rsquo; not to be
contracted.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-compbrl"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="compbrl-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">compbrl characters</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the characters are found within a block of text surrounded by
whitespace the entire block is translated according to the default
braille representations defined by the <a class="ref" href="Character_002dDefinition-Opcodes.html">Character-Definition Opcodes</a>, if 8-dot computer braille is enabled or according to the dot
patterns given in the <code class="code">comp6</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#comp6-opcode"><code class="code">comp6</code></a>), if 6-dot computer braille is
enabled. For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">compbrl www translate URLs in computer braille
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-comp6"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="comp6-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">comp6 character dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>This opcode specifies the translation of characters in 6-dot computer
braille. The first operand must be a single character. The second
operand may specify as many cells as necessary. The opcode is somewhat
of a misnomer, since any dots, not just dots 1 through 6, can be
specified. This even includes virtual dots (see <a class="pxref" href="Overview.html#virtual-dots">virtual dots</a>).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-nocont"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="nocont-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">nocont characters</code></dt>
<dd><p>Like <code class="code">compbrl</code>, except that the string is uncontracted.
<code class="code">prepunc</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#prepunc-opcode"><code class="code">prepunc</code></a>) and <code class="code">postpunc</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#postpunc-opcode"><code class="code">postpunc</code></a>) rules are applied,
however. This is useful for specifying that foreign words should not
be contracted in an entire document.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-replace"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="replace-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">replace characters {characters}</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the first set of characters, no matter where they appear, with
the second. Note that the second operand is <em class="emph">NOT</em> a dot pattern.
It is also optional. If it is omitted the character(s) in the first
operand will be discarded. This is useful for ignoring characters. It
is possible that the &quot;ignored&quot; characters may still affect the
translation indirectly. Therefore, it is preferable to use
<code class="code">correct</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="The-correct-Opcode.html#correct-opcode"><code class="code">correct</code></a>).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-always"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="always-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">always characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern no matter where they
appear. Do <em class="emph">NOT</em> use an entry such as <code class="code">always a 1</code>. Use the
character definition opcodes instead. For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">always world 456-2456 unconditional translation
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-repeated"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="repeated-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">repeated characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern no matter where they
appear. Ignore any consecutive repetitions of the same character
sequence. This is useful for shortening long strings of spaces or
hyphens or periods. For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">repeated --- 36-36-36 shorten separator lines made with hyphens
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-repword"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="repword-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">repword characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>For some braille systems there is the requirement to remove repeated
words which are connected by some character. In Malaysian braille for
example you want to contract as follows:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>Text:</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">tasik-tasik</samp>&rsquo;
</p></dd>
<dt>Grade 1:</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">2345-1-234-24-13-36-2345-1-234-24-13</samp>&rsquo;
</p></dd>
<dt>Grade 2:</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">2345-1-234-24-13-123456</samp>&rsquo;
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The dash and the second occurrence of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">tasik</samp>&rsquo; is replaced with
dots &lsquo;<samp class="samp">123456</samp>&rsquo;. To achieve this you can use the repword opcode as
follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">repword - 123456
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rependword"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="rependword-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">rependword characters dots, dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Like the <code class="code">repword</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#repword-opcode"><code class="code">repword</code></a>), but for indicating a repetition of a
string at the end of a word. When characters are encountered check to
see if a part of the word before these characters (but not the whole
word) matches the string after them. If so, insert the first dot
pattern at the position where the part of the word started, replace
characters with the second dot pattern and eliminate the repeated
string and any string following another occurrence of characters that
is the same. This opcode is used in Malaysian braille. In this case
the rule is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">rependword - 25,123456
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-largesign"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="largesign-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">largesign characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern no matter where they
appear. In addition, if two words defined as large signs follow each
other, remove the space between them. For example, in
<samp class="file">en-us-g2.ctb</samp> the words &lsquo;<samp class="samp">and</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">the</samp>&rsquo; are both
defined as large signs. Thus, in the phrase &lsquo;<samp class="samp">the cat and the dog</samp>&rsquo;
the space would be deleted between &lsquo;<samp class="samp">and</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">the</samp>&rsquo;, with the
result &lsquo;<samp class="samp">the cat andthe dog</samp>&rsquo;. Of course, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">and</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">the</samp>&rsquo;
would be properly contracted. The term <code class="code">largesign</code> is a bit of
braille jargon that pleases braille experts.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-word"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="word-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">word characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern if they are a word, that
is, are surrounded by whitespace and/or punctuation.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-syllable"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="syllable-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">syllable characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>As its name indicates, this opcode defines a &quot;syllable&quot; which must be
represented by exactly the dot patterns given. Contractions may not
cross the boundaries of this &quot;syllable&quot; either from left or right. The
character string defined by this opcode need not be a lexical
syllable, though it usually will be. The equal sign in the following
example means that the default representation for each character
within the sequence is to be used (see <a class="pxref" href="#Translation-Opcodes">Translation Opcodes</a>):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">syllable horse = sawhorse, horseradish
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-joinword"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="joinword-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">joinword characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern if they are a word which
is followed by whitespace and a letter. In addition remove the
whitespace. For example, <samp class="file">en-us-g2.ctb</samp> has <code class="code">joinword to
235</code>. This means that if the word &lsquo;<samp class="samp">to</samp>&rsquo; is followed by another
word the contraction is to be used and the space is to be omitted. If
these conditions are not met, the word is translated according to any
other opcodes that may apply to it.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-lowword"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="lowword-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">lowword characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern if they are a word
preceded and followed by whitespace. No punctuation either before or
after the word is allowed. The term <code class="code">lowword</code> derives from the
fact that in English these contractions are written in the lower part
of the cell. For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">lowword were 2356
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-contraction"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="contraction-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">contraction characters</code></dt>
<dd><p>If you look at <samp class="file">en-us-g2.ctb</samp> you will see that some words are
actually contracted into some of their own letters. A famous example
among braille transcribers is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">also</samp>&rsquo;, which is contracted as
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">al</samp>&rsquo;. But this is also the name of a person. To take another
example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">altogether</samp>&rsquo; is contracted as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">alt</samp>&rsquo;, but this is
the abbreviation for the alternate key on a computer keyboard.
Similarly &lsquo;<samp class="samp">could</samp>&rsquo; is contracted into &lsquo;<samp class="samp">cd</samp>&rsquo;, but this is the
abbreviation for compact disk. To prevent confusion in such cases, the
letter sign (see <code class="code">letsign</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Braille-Indicator-Opcodes.html#letsign-opcode"><code class="code">letsign</code></a>)) is placed before such letter
combinations when they actually are abbreviations, not contractions.
The <code class="code">contraction</code> opcode tells the translator to do this.

<a class="anchor" id="exactdots-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">exactdots @dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Note that the operand must begin with an at sign (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">@</samp>&rsquo;). The dot
pattern following it is evaluated for validity. If it is valid,
whenever an at sign followed by this dot pattern appears in the source
document it is replaced by the characters corresponding to the dot
pattern in the output. This opcode is intended for use in liblouisutdml
semantic-action files to specify exact dot patterns, as in
mathematical codes. For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">exactdots @4-46-12356
</pre></div>
<p>will produce the characters with these dot patterns in the output.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-midnum"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="midnum-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">midnum characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern if they are in the middle
of a number. For example, <samp class="file">en-us-g1.ctb</samp> has <code class="code">midnum . 46</code>.
This is because the decimal point has a different dot pattern than the
period.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-endnum"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="endnum-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><code class="code">endnum characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern if they are at the end of
a number. For example <samp class="file">en-us-g1.ctb</samp> has <code class="code">endnum th 1456</code>.
This handles things like &lsquo;<samp class="samp">4th</samp>&rsquo;. A letter sign is <em class="emph">NOT</em>
inserted.

<dt><code class="code">joinnum characters dots</code></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the characters with the dot pattern. In addition, if
whitespace and a number follows omit the whitespace. This opcode can
be used to join currency symbols to numbers for example:

joinnum \x0024 145 (DOLLAR SIGN)
joinnum \x00A3 1234 (POUND SIGN)
