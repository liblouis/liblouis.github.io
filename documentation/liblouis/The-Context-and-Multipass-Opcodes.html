<h3 class="section" id="The-Context-and-Multipass-Opcodes-1"><span>2.12 The Context and Multipass Opcodes<a class="copiable-link" href="#The-Context-and-Multipass-Opcodes-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>The <code class="code">context</code> and multipass opcodes (<code class="code">pass2</code>, <code class="code">pass3</code>
and <code class="code">pass4</code>) provide translation capabilities beyond those of the
basic translation opcodes (see <a class="pxref" href="Translation-Opcodes.html">Translation Opcodes</a>) discussed
previously. The multipass opcodes cause additional passes to be made
over the string to be translated. The number after the word
<code class="code">pass</code> indicates in which pass the entry is to be applied. If no
multipass opcodes are given, only the first translation pass is made.
The <code class="code">context</code> opcode is basically a multipass opcode for the
first pass. It differs slightly from the multipass opcodes per se.
When back-translating, the passes are performed in the reverse order,
i.e. <code class="code">pass4</code>, <code class="code">pass3</code>, <code class="code">pass2</code>, <code class="code">context</code>. Each
of these opcodes must be prefixed by either the <code class="code">noback</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Translation-Opcodes.html#noback-opcode"><code class="code">noback</code></a>) or
the <code class="code">nofor</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Translation-Opcodes.html#nofor-opcode"><code class="code">nofor</code></a>). The format of all these opcodes is <code class="code">opcode
test action</code>. The specific opcodes are invoked as follows:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dd><a class="anchor" id="context-opcode"></a></dd>
<dt><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-pass2"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-pass3"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-pass4"></a>
<a id="index-context"></a><span><code class="code">context test action</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-context"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dt><code class="code">pass2 test action</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">pass3 test action</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">pass4 test action</code></dt>
</dl>

<p>The <code class="code">test</code> and <code class="code">action</code> operands have suboperands. Each
suboperand begins with a non-alphanumeric character and ends when
another non-alphanumeric character is encountered. The suboperands and
their initial characters are as follows.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><kbd class="kbd">&quot; (double quote)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>a string of characters. This string must be terminated by another
double quote. It may contain any characters. If a double quote is
needed within the string, it must be preceded by a backslash
(&lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;). If a space is needed, it must be represented by the escape
sequence \s. This suboperand is valid
in the test and action parts of the <code class="code">correct</code> opcode,
in the test part of the <code class="code">context</code> opcode when forward translating,
and in the action part of the <code class="code">context</code> opcode when back translating.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">@ (at sign)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>a sequence of dot patterns. Cells are separated by hyphens as usual.
This suboperand is valid in the test and action parts of
the <code class="code">pass2</code>, <code class="code">pass3</code>, and <code class="code">pass4</code> opcodes,
in the action part of the <code class="code">context</code> opcode when forward translating,
and in the test part of the <code class="code">context</code> opcode when back translating.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">` (accent mark)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>If this is the beginning of the string being translated this
suboperand is true. It is valid only in the test part and must be the
first thing in this operand.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">~ (tilde)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>If this is the end of the string being translated this suboperand is
true. It is valid only in the test part and must be the last thing in
this operand.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">$ (dollar sign)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>a string of attributes, such as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">d</samp>&rsquo; for digit, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">l</samp>&rsquo; for
letter, etc. For a list of all valid attributes see <a class="pxref" href="#valid-attribute-characters">valid attribute characters</a>. More than one attribute can be given. If you wish to
check characters with any attribute, use the letter &lsquo;<samp class="samp">a</samp>&rsquo;. Input
characters are checked to see if they have at least one of the
attributes. The attribute string can be followed by numbers specifying
how many characters are to be checked. If no numbers are given, 1 is
assumed. If two numbers separated by a hyphen are given, the input is
checked to make sure that at least the first number of characters with
the attributes are present, but no more than the second number. If
only one number is present, then exactly that many characters must
have the attributes. A period instead of the numbers indicates an
indefinite number of characters (for technical reasons the number of
characters that are actually matched is limited to 65535).
</p>
<p>This suboperand is valid in all test parts but not in action parts.
For the characters which can be used in attribute strings, see the
following table.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">! (exclamation point)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>reverses the logical meaning of the suboperand which follows. For
example, !$d is true only if the character is <em class="emph">NOT</em> a digit. This
suboperand is valid in test parts only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">% (percent sign)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>the name of a character class, predefined or defined using the
<code class="code">attribute</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Character_002dClass-Opcodes.html#attribute-opcode"><code class="code">attribute</code></a>), or the name of a swap set defined by the swap
opcodes (see <a class="pxref" href="Swap-Opcodes.html">Swap Opcodes</a>). Names must contain only letters (a-z
and A-Z). The letters may be upper or lower-case but the case
matters. Character class names may be used in test parts only. Swap
names are valid everywhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">{ (left brace)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Name: the name of a grouping pair. The left brace indicates that the
first (or left) member of the pair is to be used in matching. If this
is between replacement brackets it must be the only item. This is also
valid in the action part.
</p>
<p>The brace actions, <code class="code">{name</code> and <code class="code">}name</code>, refer to named
groupings. A grouping is created with the <code class="code">grouping</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Character_002dDefinition-Opcodes.html#grouping-opcode"><code class="code">grouping</code></a>) and
contains exactly two characters which represent the opening character
and the matching closing character for a character grouping. The first
operand is the grouping name, the second is the two (opening and
closing) characters, and the third is the two dot patterns separated
by a comma.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;d like to define the opening and closing
parentheses via multipass rules, and that you&rsquo;d like to use dots
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">123478</samp>&rsquo; for the opening parenthesis and dots &lsquo;<samp class="samp">145678</samp>&rsquo; for
the closing parenthesis. One way to do so is like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">grouping parentheses () 123478,145678
noback correct {parentheses {parentheses
noback correct }parentheses }parentheses
</pre></div>

<p>The references within the test part of the multipass rule match
against the characters (the second operand) of the grouping rule, and
the references within the action part replace with the dot patterns
(the third operand) of the grouping.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">} (right brace)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Name: the name of a grouping pair. The right brace indicates that the
second (or right) member is to be used in matching. See the remarks on
the left brace immediately above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">/ (slash)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Search the input for the expression following the slash and return
true if found. This can be used to set a variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">_ (underscore)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Move backward. If a number follows, move backward that number of
characters. The default is to move backward one character. This
suboperand is valid only in test parts. The test fails if moving
backward beyond the beginning of the input string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">[ (left bracket)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Start replacement here. This suboperand must always be paired with a
right bracket and is valid only in test parts. Multiple pairs of
square brackets in a single expression are not allowed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">] (right bracket)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>End replacement here. This suboperand must always be paired with a
left bracket and is valid only in test parts.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd"># (number sign or crosshatch)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Test or set a variable. Variables are referred to by numbers
(0 through 49), e.g. <code class="code">#1</code>, <code class="code">#2</code>, <code class="code">#25</code>.
Variables may be set by one <code class="code">context</code> or multipass opcode and tested
by another. Thus, an operation that occurs at one place in a translation
can tell an operation that occurs later within the same pass about itself.
This feature is used in math translation, and may also help to alleviate
the need for new opcodes. This suboperand is valid everywhere.
</p>
<p>Variables are set in the action part. To set a variable, use an
expression like <code class="code">#1=1</code>. All of the variables are initialized to 0
at the start of each pass.
</p>
<p>Variables can also be incremented and decremented by one in the action
part with expressions like <code class="code">#1+</code> and <code class="code">#3-</code> respectively.
An attempt to decrement a variable below 0 is silently ignored.
</p>
<p>Variables are tested in the test part with conditional expressions like:
<code class="code">#1=2</code>, <code class="code">#3&lt;4</code>, <code class="code">#5&gt;6</code>, <code class="code">#7&lt;=8</code>, <code class="code">#9&gt;=10</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">* (asterisk)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Copy the input characters or dot patterns within the replacement brackets
into the output, and discard anything else that was matched. If there are
no replacement brackets then copy all of the matched input. This
suboperand is only valid within the action part. It may be specified any
number of times. This feature is used, for example, for handling numeric
subscripts in Nemeth.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">? (question mark)</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Valid only in the action part. The characters to be replaced are
simply ignored. That is, they are replaced with nothing. If either
member of a grouping pair is in the replace brackets the other member
at the same level is also removed.
</p>
</dd>

<p>The following illustrates the algorithm how text is evaluated with
multipass expressions:
</p>
<p>Loop over context, pass2, pass3 and pass4 and do the following for each pass:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate" type="a" start="1">
<li> Match the text following the cursor against all expressions in the
current pass. If an expression has square brackets to indicate the
part to be replaced, and the opening bracket would correspond with a
position before the cursor, it is not a match.
</li><li> If there is no match: shift the cursor one position to the right and
continue the loop
</li><li> If there are matches: choose the longest match
</li><li> Do the replacement. If the expression has square brackets, the part of
the input that matches the part in between the brackets is replaced
with the right-hand side of the rule. If the expression has no square
brackets, the whole match is replaced.
</li><li> Place the cursor after the replaced text
</li><li> continue loop
</li></ol>

<p>Normally, when a rule is applied, the characters in the input that the
rule applies to are &quot;consumed&quot;, i.e. the position of the input string
is stepped forward, and the characters are no longer available for
subsequent rules.  However, with the multipass opcodes, the
<code class="code">context</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#context-opcode"><code class="code">context</code></a>) opcode and the <code class="code">correct</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="The-correct-Opcode.html#correct-opcode"><code class="code">correct</code></a>) opcode, it is
possible to make rules which don&rsquo;t consume any characters from the
input. This could happen, e.g. if you use the <code class="code">context</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="#context-opcode"><code class="code">context</code></a>)
opcode to insert a dot pattern before a special group of characters.
In these cases, Liblouis will always advance the position by one
character to make sure that the program doesn&rsquo;t apply a rule to the
same characters again and again.
