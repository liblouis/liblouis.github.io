<p>Contrary to older versions of liblouis there is limited fallback
behavior. Generally opcodes have a very specific purpose. This is done
for the sake of simplicity. While it would be possible to support more
combinations of rules, Liblouis chooses to signal an error when
certain combinations of opcodes are used (or not used).
</p>
<p>For example, when a <code class="code">begemphphrase</code> rule is defined it is
required that there is also an <code class="code">endemphphrase</code>
definition. <code class="code">begemph</code> must be combined with <code class="code">endemph</code>. A
<code class="code">begemphphrase</code> rule is only allowed if there is also a
<code class="code">begemphword</code>. <code class="code">begemph</code> and <code class="code">begemphword</code> are mutually
exclusive. Etc.
</p>
<p>When new requirements for indicating emphasis arise that are not
supported yet, either more opcode combinations might be enabled, or
more specific opcodes might be added.
