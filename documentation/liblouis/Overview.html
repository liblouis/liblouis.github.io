<p>Many translation (contraction) tables have already been made up. They
are included in the distribution in the tables directory and can be
studied as part of the documentation. Some of the more helpful (and
normative) are listed in the following table:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><samp class="file">chardefs.cti</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Character definitions for U.S. tables
</p></dd>
<dt><samp class="file">compress.ctb</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Remove excessive whitespace
</p></dd>
<dt><samp class="file">en-us-g1.ctb</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Uncontracted American English
</p></dd>
<dt><samp class="file">en-us-g2.ctb</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Contracted or Grade 2 American English
</p></dd>
<dt><samp class="file">en-us-brf.dis</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Make liblouis output conform to BRF standard
</p></dd>
<dt><samp class="file">en-us-comp8.ctb</samp></dt>
<dd><p>8-dot computer braille for use in coding examples
</p></dd>
<dt><samp class="file">en-us-comp6.ctb</samp></dt>
<dd><p>6-dot computer braille
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The names used for files containing translation tables are completely
arbitrary. They are not interpreted in any way by the translator.
Contraction tables may be 8-bit ASCII files, UTF-8, 16-bit big-endian
Unicode files or 16-bit little-endian Unicode files. Blank lines are
ignored. Any leading and trailing whitespace (any number of blanks
and/or tabs) is ignored. Lines which begin with a number sign or hatch
mark (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">#</samp>&rsquo;) are ignored, i.e. they are comments. If the number
sign is not the first non-blank character in the line, it is treated
as an ordinary character. If the first non-blank character is
less-than (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;</samp>&rsquo;) the line is also treated as a comment. This makes
it possible to mark up tables as xhtml documents. Lines which are not
blank or comments define table entries. The general format of a table
entry is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">opcode operands comments
</pre></div>

<p>Table entries may not be split between lines. The opcode is a mnemonic
that specifies what the entry does. The operands may be character
sequences, braille dot patterns or occasionally something else. They
are described for each opcode, please see <a class="pxref" href="Opcode-Index.html">Opcode Index</a>. With some
exceptions, opcodes expect a certain number of operands. Any text on
the line after the last operand is ignored, and may be a comment. A
few opcodes accept a variable number of operands. In this case a
number sign (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">#</samp>&rsquo;) begins a comment unless it is preceded by a
backslash (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of table entries.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"># This is a comment.
always world 456-2456 A word and the dot pattern of its contraction
</pre></div>

<p>Most opcodes have both a &quot;characters&quot; operand and a &quot;dots&quot; operand,
though some have only one and a few have other types.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Characters-operand"></a>
<p>The characters operand consists of any combination of characters and
escape sequences proceeded and followed by whitespace. Escape
sequences are used to represent difficult characters. They begin with
a backslash (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;). They are:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>backslash
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\f</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>form feed
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\n</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>new line
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\r</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>carriage return
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\s</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>blank (space)
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\t</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>horizontal tab
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\v</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>vertical tab
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\e</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>&quot;escape&quot; character (hex 1b, dec 27)
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\xhhhh</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>4-digit hexadecimal value of a character
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>If liblouis has been compiled for 32-bit Unicode the following are
also recognized.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\yhhhhh</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>5-digit (20 bit) character
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">\zhhhhhhhh</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Full 32-bit value.
</p>
<p>Please take a look at the
<a class="url" href="https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/">public directory of the
Unicode Character Database</a> as well as at the
<a class="url" href="https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt">Unicode names
list with their code points</a> to figure out the corresponding Unicode
code point for a given Unicode character.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Dots-operand"></a>
<p>The dots operand is a braille dot pattern. The real braille dots, 1
through 8, must be specified with their standard numbers.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Virtual-dots"></a>
<a class="anchor" id="virtual-dots"></a><p>liblouis recognizes <em class="emph">virtual dots</em>, which are used for special
purposes, such as distinguishing accent marks. There are seven virtual
dots. They are specified by the number 9 and the letters &lsquo;<samp class="samp">a</samp>&rsquo;
through &lsquo;<samp class="samp">f</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Multi_002dcell-dot-pattern"></a>
<p>For a multi-cell dot pattern, the cell specifications must be
separated from one another by a dash (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">-</samp>&rsquo;). For example, the
contraction for the English word &lsquo;<samp class="samp">lord</samp>&rsquo; (the letter &lsquo;<samp class="samp">l</samp>&rsquo;
preceded by dot 5) would be specified as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">5-123</samp>&rsquo;. A space may be
specified with the special dot number 0.
</p>
<p>An opcode which is helpful in writing translation tables is
<code class="code">include</code>. Its format is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">include filename
</pre></div>

<p>It reads the file indicated by <code class="code">filename</code> and incorporates or
includes its entries into the table. Included files can include other
files, which can include other files, etc. For an example, see what
files are included by the entry <code class="code">include en-us-g1.ctb</code> in the table
<samp class="file">en-us-g2.ctb</samp>. If the included file is not in the same directory
as the main table, use a full path name for filename. Tables can also be
specified in a table list, in which the table names are separated by
commas and given as a single table name in calls to the translation
functions.
</p>
<p>The order of the various types of opcodes or table entries is
important. Character-definition opcodes should come first. However, if
the optional <code class="code">display</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Miscellaneous-Opcodes.html#display-opcode"><code class="code">display</code></a>) is used it should precede
character-definition opcodes. Braille-indicator opcodes should come
next. Translation opcodes should follow. The <code class="code">context</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="The-Context-and-Multipass-Opcodes.html#context-opcode"><code class="code">context</code></a>) is a
translation opcode, even though it is considered along with the
multipass opcodes. These latter should follow the translation opcodes.
The <code class="code">correct</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="The-correct-Opcode.html#correct-opcode"><code class="code">correct</code></a>) can be used anywhere after the
character-definition opcodes, but it is probably a good idea to group
all <code class="code">correct</code> opcodes together. The <code class="code">include</code> opcode (see <a class="pxref" href="Miscellaneous-Opcodes.html#include-opcode"><code class="code">include</code></a>) can be
used anywhere, but the order of entries in the combined table must
conform to the order given above. Within each type of opcode, the
order of entries is generally unimportant. Thus the translation
entries can be grouped alphabetically or in any other order that is
convenient. Hyphenation tables may be specified either with an 
<code class="code">include</code> opcode or as part of a table list. They should come after 
everything else.
