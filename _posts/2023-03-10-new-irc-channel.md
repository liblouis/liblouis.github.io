Irc is the venerable tool to do real-time chat. Some of the liblouis
developers used to hang out on a channel on the oftc network.

We now have a new channel on libera.chat were we hang out.

Come by and talk to us on the #liblouis channel at irc.libera.chat.
You can use the [web client](https://web.libera.chat/#liblouis) for
example.
