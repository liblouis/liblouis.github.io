---

We were deeply saddened to hear of the death of [Mike
Gray](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/louisville/name/michael-gray-obituary?pid=198063080).
He was absolutely instrumental in the [implementation of UEB in
liblouis](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/blob/master/NEWS#noteworthy-changes-in-release-300-2016-07-14).

Many of his ideas and his code code contributions will live on in liblouis.
