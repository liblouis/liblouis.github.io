## Braille translator and back-translator

**Liblouis** is an open-source braille translator and back-translator named in honor of [Louis Braille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Braille). It features support for computer and literary braille, supports contracted and uncontracted translation for [many languages](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/tree/master/tables) and has support for hyphenation. New languages can easily be added through tables that support a rule- or dictionary based approach. Tools for testing and debugging tables are also included. Liblouis also supports math braille (Nemeth and Marburg).

Liblouis has features to support screen-reading programs. This has led to its use in numerous open-source and proprietary screenreaders such as [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org/), [Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca), [BrailleBack](https://github.com/google/brailleback) and [JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS). It is also used in some commercial assistive technology applications for example by [ViewPlus](http://www.viewplus.com).

Liblouis is the translator of choice for Benetechâ€™s [Bookshare](http://www.bookshare.org), providing braille access to more than 350,000 books to members worldwide. Bookshare currently offers titles in braille in more than a dozen languages, with the ability to quickly add new languages as translation tables become available.

Liblouis is based on the translation routines in the [BRLTTY](http://mielke.cc/brltty/) screenreader for Linux. It has, however, gone far beyond these routines. In Linux and Mac OSX it is a shared library, and in Windows it is a DLL.

## Language bindings

The software has interfaces to a number of programming languages. There are known bindings to C, [Python](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/tree/master/python), [Java](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis-java) and [Javascript](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis-js).

## Braille formatter

**Liblouisutdml** is an open-source braille formatter. The formatting can be configured via a style sheet. By incorporating Liblouis it provides the capability of translating any XML or plain text file into properly transcribed, embosser-ready braille. This includes translation into grade two, mathematical codes, etc.

Liblouisutdml is free software licensed under the [GNU Lesser GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).


## Braille production

There are several braille production systems based on Liblouis and/or Liblouisutdml.

[BrailleBlaster](http://www.brailleblaster.org), a joint project between ViewPlus Technologies, American Printing House for the Blind and Abilitiessoft, is aimed at hands-on production where every detail of the Braille is controlled via a graphical user interface.

[DAISY Pipeline](http://www.daisy.org/pipeline2), backed by the DAISY Consortium, is aimed at automated, hands-off, high-volume production on the server.

[Sao Mai Braille](http://saomaicenter.org/en/smsoft/smb), a rich text editing and Braille translation software for Windows, is developed by Sao Mai Center for the Blind, a non-profit organization based in Vietnam.
